# Netflix Clone #
This is a fully responsive clone website of popular streaming service Netflix built using React.js. Built this project because I was always fascianted by the beautiful
interface Netflix has while displaying all the content thumbnails in an efficient way.

This project currently has the mentioned features :
- Fetches the content that is popular in the country of the user.
- Contains the big display header and different genre categories as seen in the original Netflix.
- Clicking a movie banner will display the trailer of that movie or series in youtube.
- The website is fully responsive

TechStack Used: React.js, API fetch

Additional API or package used: TMDB API, movie-trailer package
